	</div>

	<h2>Demo</h2>
	<div class="sectiontext">

		<p>Below are some regular links, with no mention of JavaScripting at all. The code for the first link, for example, is <code>&lt;a href="betty.mp3"&gt;betty&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
		<p><b>Click randomly on a bunch of them to see what happens.</b></p>

		<a href="betty.mp3">betty</a>
		<a href="creeeeak.mp3">creeeeak</a>
		<a href="creeeeak.mp3">creeeeak again</a>
		<a href="creeeeak.mp3">creeeeak yet again</a>

		<p>(I repeated the same file several times because of bandwith, but you can link as many files as you want)</p>

		<p>What this script does is convert regular links to mp3 files into something you can click to queue a song up and right click and choose "save as" to download.</p>

&lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="flashmp3alizer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
			</li>

		</ol>
	</div>

	<h2>Wishlist:</h2>
	<div class="sectiontext">
		<ol>
			<li><del>Make it work in IE</del> done! (version 0.2)</li>
			<li><del>Make the popup reusable when you change site and leave the popup open.</del> done! (version 0.3)</li>
			<li>Add more options, like "play all", and "play all files in selection"</li>
			<li>Add a "clear" button</li>
			<li>Make the playlist songs moveable</li>
			<li>Make it work without a popup (if desired, as per the configuration file)</li>
			<li>Allow preset playlists -- although i have to figure out how to implement this one: i'm thinking about using divs to separate the different playlists or something like that.</li>
			<li>Make the niftyplayer read an xml file with color information, so you can match your site's theme</li>
			<li>Id3 support would be good</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>News</h2>
	<div class="sectiontext">
		<p>I fixed a major bug, so i bumped it to version 0.4. The bug was in the way i was loading the script, which would sometimes happen BEFORE the page was completely loaded, causing things to royally screw.</p>
		<p>Whoever was using this script with the useOnLoad set to "true", should now try with "false" and tell me if it works. The useOnLoad method is a sure-thing way of doing things, but it's much slower for image-heavy pages than the way i have now.</p>
		<p>If you can't be bothered with this jibbajabba, just plug the scripts right before the &lt;/body&gt; tag (and set useOnLoad:false). This is the ugly way of fixing any bugs I may eventually find in my new loading script.</p>
		<p>Now with "News" section!</p>
